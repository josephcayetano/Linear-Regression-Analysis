# D600-Task-1-Linear-Regression-Analysis
### Overview
This project focuses on predicting housing prices using multiple linear regression. By analyzing property and neighborhood characteristics, the project builds and optimizes a regression model to identify key factors affecting house prices. The model is implemented in Python (pandas, statsmodels), and performance is evaluated through statistical metrics and visualization.

### Multiple Linear Regression – Housing Price Prediction
-	Built and optimized a multiple linear regression model to predict housing prices using property and neighborhood features (e.g., SquareFootage, CrimeRate, RenovationQuality).
-	Achieved an R² of ~0.60, identifying key price drivers; applied backward stepwise elimination to improve model simplicity and performance.
-	Utilized Python (pandas, statsmodels) and visualized results with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
