# Linear Regression Analysis
### Overview
This project used multiple linear regression to predict housing prices. By analyzing property and neighborhood features, I built and improved a model that shows which factors affect price the most. I used Python with pandas and statsmodels, and evaluated the model using visualizations and key statistics.

### Multiple Linear Regression – Housing Price Prediction
-	Created a regression model to predict home prices using features like square footage, crime rate, and renovation quality.
-	Improved model performance using backward stepwise elimination, achieving an R² of around 0.60.
-	Used Python (pandas, statsmodels) and visualized results with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
